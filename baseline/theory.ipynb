    "However, our optimization problem does not involve $\\mathbf{m}$ in isolation, but rather through $\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{m}$, which via this decomposition is equal to $\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{\\tilde{m}}$. This creates an ambiguity with the problem as we were previously solving for $\\mathbf{m}$ without the decomposition. To resolve for this ambiguity, we can solve for $\\tilde{\\mathbf{m}}$ instead in the co-ordinate descent scheme, by inserting the additional constraint $\\tilde{\\mathbf{m}}^{T}\\mathbf{1} = 0$, which enforces stationarity.\n",

    "Recall that the Laplacian $\\mathbf{L}$ is a $(15\\times 15)$ square matrix, with each of the 15 rows representing the number of maturities ranging from 1 to 30, on any given yield curve. The $i^{th}$ row of the Laplacian is a measure of the curvature of node $i$, which is an individual maturity, relative to the other maturities. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was observed that each row of the Laplacian matrix had a spike pattern, a close replication of the stencil unique to that of the 1-D Laplacian operator. Furthermore, for each row the location of the spike is equal to the row number, and this is expected because as mentioned above each row is associated with the curvature of the corresponding maturity relative to the other maturities for a particular trading day (e.g. the values in row 14 correspond to the curvature of the 30Y swap rate relative to the other maturities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the Laplacian matrix can be thought of a set of portfolio weights that sum to zero to trade the yield curves. Each row is therefore a portfolio representative of that row’s node maturity, and hence the dot product $\\mathbf{L}(t)\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\mathbf{\\lambda}(t)$ generates a $15 \\times 1$ column vector where the $i^{th}$ value of this column vector is the value of the particular portfolio corresponding to the index of the $i^{th}$ maturity for a given unit of time $t$. As a result, in this context 'trading the $i^{th}$ maturity' refers to trading the particular portfolio (dictated by the $i^{th}$ row of $\\mathbf{L}$) associated with that maturity. For instance, trading the 1Y maturity would mean trading the portfolio associated with row 0 of the Laplacian, as it is the row that corresponds to the 1Y node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trading signal comes from $\\tilde{\\mathbf{m}}$, the diffusive parameter of the yield curve, and therefore the curvature for a given unit of time $t$ is calculated by $\\mathbf{L}(t)\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\tilde{\\mathbf{m}}(t)$. This dot product essentially tells us the curvature of the portfolio associated with the $i^{th}$ maturity, and the trading signal we have opted for is to short the portfolio (e.g. negative exposure) if the curvature is greater than a threshold $\\tau$, and long the portfolio if the curvature is less than $-\\tau$. If on any particular day a portfolio has a curvature between $-\\tau$ and $\\tau$, none of the assets in that portfolio are traded, resulting in zero profits for that day. The rationale behind this strategy is that if the curvature on any given day is deemed 'too high', we initiate a short position as we are betting that the yield curve will diffuse back towards the mean (i.e. that the yield curve will mean revert), and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our swap rate profits assumption (see section below), a long portfolio trade will take profits as $\\mathbf{L}(t)\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}[\\mathbf{\\lambda}(t+1) - \\mathbf{\\lambda}(t)]$, and a short portfolio trade will take profits as $\\mathbf{L}(t)\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}[\\mathbf{\\lambda}(t) - \\mathbf{\\lambda}(t+1)]$, both of which are controlled by the curvature condition from the above paragraph. The constant of proportionality between the swap rate change and its profit unknown and for the purposes of this strategy it is assumed to be 1 for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The profits function therefore takes in the Laplacian matrices generated for each period of time $t$, and uses it to calculate the value of the aforementioned maturity portfolios. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the weights of each portfolio sum to zero, we have created what is known as a 'Zero-Investment Portfolio', which is a collection of investments that has a net value of zero when the portfolio is assembled, and effectively requires the investor to take no stake in the portfolio \\cite{zeroinvportfolio}. Because there is a new $\\mathbf{L}$ every day, we are essentially using the $\\mathbf{L}$ for that day to enter a position on that day and then exiting the day after to capture a potential profit. Note that the daily investment amount for each of these portfolios does not matter as it effectively costs nothing to trade the portfolio; the short positions finance the long positions. The profit is therefore proportional to the daily investment amount for each portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the domain of yield curve trading, a cash-neutral butterfly trade is a portfolio where the weights of the maturity components are adjusted so that the combination presents a null dollar duration and is a self-financed transaction (zero-investment portfolio) \\cite{butterflystrategy}, a common yield curve arbitrage strategy used amongst practitioners. Usually the butterfly strategy is structured to present a positive gain for parallel yield curve shifts, but there are different types of butterflies that are structured to generate a positive pay-off in the event a particular yield curve movement. In our case with the Laplacian portfolios, it holds real life relevance in the sense that it is somewhat similar to the butterfly strategy, but however each portfolio is unlikely to have a net zero duration. In theory this makes the portfolios less immune to interest rate risk, but we shall see in the next section how profitable our 'butterfly' strategy is."

    "It was originally proposed that US Treasury yield data was to be used as the data source, but however swap data is more suitable because, for instance, the maturity of a 5Y bond today will not be 5Y one day later, and therefore another variable will have to be introduced to model this shift in maturity. In contrast, the reason for using swap rates is because for any particular swap rate maturity (e.g. 10Y), the corresponding 10Y swap contract is priced from scratch daily. Therefore, a time-series of a particular 10Y swap rate will always refer to the stated maturity. The treasury yield curve consists of bonds, which are not issued daily and hence as each day goes by, the treasuries roll down the curve and their maturity decreases.\n",

Although this is a very rough valuation of an interest rate swap, we can see that there is a degree of proportionality between the swap price $P_{IRS}$ and swap rate $R$, i.e. when the swap rate goes up so will the swap value. Hence, a swaps profitability is proportional to the change in swap rates."

    "The strategy performed best across different swap curves with a larger backtesting rolling window size as well as a curvature threshold of 0, allowing the model to place more total trades, hence increasing its potential to generate more winning trades. However, this style of trading is purely theoretical and not possible in the real world because zero-investment portfolios do not exist!! \n",

    "Firstly, when an investor borrows an asset from a broker to short it, there is an interest rate associated with this loan which varies depending on the assets availability, and secondly, trading commissions will be extremely costly for this strategy because we are essentially trading 15 portfolios per day, with 15 rates in each portfolio. This means that there is an upper bound of 225 sets of commissions to be paid per day if all portfolios are traded on that day. It is also extremely impractical to trade so many assets per day."
